# Flutter AI Agents

> Specialized AI agents for Flutter/Dart development with Clean Architecture, organized by Clean Architecture layers.

##  Agent Organization

All agents are organized following Clean Architecture layers for easy discovery and use:

```
flutter-ai-agent/
├── architecture/       # High-level design and planning
├── data/              # Data layer implementation
├── domain/            # Business logic and entities
├── presentation/      # UI and state management
├── infrastructure/    # Cross-cutting concerns
└── quality/          # Testing and quality assurance
```

##  Implementation Workflow

### Follow this order for EVERY new feature:

```
1. flutter-feature-planner    → Analyze codebase (MANDATORY)
2. flutter-domain             → Entities & Repository Interface
3. flutter-use-cases          → UseCases with validation
4. flutter-data-layer         → DataSource & Models
5. flutter-repository         → Repository Implementation
6. flutter-di                 → Register DataSource, Repository, UseCases
7. flutter-state              → States & Cubit
8. flutter-di                 → Register Cubit
9. flutter-ui                 → Page & Widgets
10. flutter-router            → Register Routes
11. flutter-tester            → Write Tests
12. flutter-quality           → Code Review & Quality Check
```

## ️ Critical Rules

### Clean Architecture Flow

```
UI → CUBIT → USE CASE → REPOSITORY → DATA SOURCE
```

### Never Skip Layers!

-  UI calling UseCase directly
-  Cubit calling Repository directly
-  UseCase calling DataSource directly

### Validation ONLY in UseCases

-  UseCases validate ALL business rules
-  UI, Cubit, Repository should NOT validate

### Analyze Existing Codebase

**BEFORE implementing ANY feature**:

- Use Glob to find similar implementations
- Use Grep to search for patterns
- Review existing code structure
- Identify reusable components
- Maintain consistency

### No Empty UI Actions

-  Empty `onPressed`
-  "Em desenvolvimento" messages
-  Every action invokes Cubit

### Register Everything

- ️ ALL pages in GoRouter
- ️ ALL classes in DI
- ️ NO manual instantiation

### Use Design System

-  AppColors, AppSpacing, AppTypography
-  NO hardcoded values

### Zero Tolerance

-  ZERO warnings
-  ZERO errors
-  ZERO useless comments
-  `flutter analyze` = **No issues found!**

---

##  Codebase Analysis

### Finding Existing Patterns

Before implementing new features, analyze your codebase:

**Using Glob tool:**

- `**/*user*.dart` - Find user-related files
- `**/*_cubit.dart` - Find all Cubits
- `**/*_repository.dart` - Find all Repositories

**Using Grep tool:**

- Search for: `class.*Cubit` - Find Cubit patterns
- Search for: `class.*Repository` - Find Repository patterns
- Search for: `class.*UseCase` - Find UseCase patterns

This ensures consistency and reusability!

---

##  Best Practices

### Multi-Agent Approach

1. **Planning**: feature-planner + architect
2. **Implementation**: domain + data + presentation agents
3. **Infrastructure**: di + router + services
4. **Quality**: tester + quality

### Proactive Quality

- During development: Follow quality guidelines
- After implementation: Run quality checks
- Before PR: Write tests

---

##  Golden Rule

> **"SE FOI CRIADO, TEM QUE FUNCIONAR 100%"**

- No empty actions
- No "Em desenvolvimento"
- No shortcuts
- Always Clean Architecture
- Always analyze existing codebase
- Always register in DI and Router
- Always validate in UseCases
- Always use Design System
- Always write tests
- Always zero linter issues

**Quality is non-negotiable.**
